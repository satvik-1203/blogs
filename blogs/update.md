# Update

I last coded a few months ago. No projects, fuzzy schoolwork, and loss of motivation; however, I developed a few skills that would help me a lot soon. These are public speaking, one-to-one interviews, and watching the news. 

From now on, I'll be working on a project that I'm trying to push up as a start-up; I also plan on making a clothing brand for which I started learning to sew; and finally, I plan to get into real estate in the summer. 

I'll discuss the idea of the start-up in another blog, but the goal for the project is to finish the refined MVP model by the summer and have 3-5 beta testers test it regularly during the summer. I'll work on getting the product out publicly while working on the feedback beta testers provide. 

Sewing clothes comes as a surprise for sure, even for me. But in recent months, the fashion industry got me eaten much more than I realized. And finding the exact clothes I want is either too costly, or I need help finding them. The fact that people on the internet are more creative and making them for a much lower price just captivated my interest. I'll also blog about my journey going further. 

Finally, we got my real estate interest. I know very little about how to proceed in this field, but I see an expert under who I could work. So, over the summer, when I return to India, I'll work under him and gain as much experience as possible.

I wish I could achieve all these goals during my last year of undergrad.
